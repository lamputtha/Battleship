# Battleship Game

Battleship is a game about sinking the other players ship. i have made a version of the game where you play against a computer, where the goal is to sink the 5 ships with as few tries as possible
the game is targeted to people who wants to play battleship but do not have anyone to play with.

the game features a 10x10 board. the boats are on are already placed randomly on a "hidden board"
it also features a score system with with

red = miss
you have unlimited tries to hit. the game uses 5 ships with different sizes. the sizes are as followed:

x1 - 5 tile ship
1x - 4 tile ship
1x - 3 tile ship
2x - 2 tile ships

the sizes are based on the base board game

The game is designed with smaller tiles as hit and miss because it was a bit hard on the eyes with full filled tiles

# Testing
The game had a few bugs. the "you win did not work correctly when i tried using limited tries. the solution was to give the player unlimited tries

# Credit
The site is pure code without any images so no credit can be credited, tho the theme is kind of copied from discord dark mode. but not in the same colors. i wanted the site to be easy on the eyes and not use a white background.
